🌟 My name is Theo, I'm 20 years old, I'm currently training at [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/) as a [Front-end web developper](https://openclassrooms.com/en/paths/594-integrateur-web).

💻 I'm passionate about web development and I don't set any limits for myself; even if I was originally oriented towards the front-end, I'm open to all opportunities, and I'm ready to learn new things.

⚡ I have a lot of energy to complete my projects, which allows me to always stay motivated by the work I undertake.

🔭 I’m currently working on [Study](https://github.com/bourdier/study), an application to track learning. <br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and React. <br>
🐧 I use Fedora 37 as daily driver.
